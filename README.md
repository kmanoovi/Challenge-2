# Challenge-2

I have designed my online portfolio using tools we have learned in class
in HTML and CSS.

Section information includes an About Me, how to contact me, projects
I have completed, and my CVC.

There are active links for contact and the CVC is able to be opened.

The links for the projects lead to a filler link (Google.com) since I do not currently have any projects to link.

The navbar at the top will bring the user to each section, which will become
more noticeable as the paragraphs increase as time goes on.

The CSS and HTML files have a logical flow and mirror each other.
