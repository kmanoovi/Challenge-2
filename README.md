# Challenge-2

I have designed my online portfolio using tools we have learned in class
in HTML and CSS.

Section information includes an About Me, how to contact me, projects
I have completed, and my CVC.

The navbar at the top will bring the user to each section, which will become
more noticeable as the paragraphs increase as time goes on.
